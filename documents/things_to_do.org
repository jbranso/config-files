<x-color><param>#DFAF8F</param>* collection notes</x-color>

write down a quick note of the stuff you need done. Don't think about next action items or scheduling. Just write down
the things you need to do.

<x-color><param>#DFAF8F</param>* process notes</x-color>

process the top item first and work your way down one at a time. Don't skip items unless skipping will appease your adhd.
If you are going down the list, and see something that needs attention further on, don't skip the item that you are on. If you do,
you are likely to forget the stuff that you are doing now.
Look at the item and first figure out if you do it.
If you can't act on it, delete it, incubate it for later review, store it as reference material.
If you can act on it, determine the next action and if it will take less than 2 minutes to do it, do it.
If it will take longer than 2 minutes, determine if it is a project and mark it as such, so you can do the next next action
after the next action is done.
If it is a task, which means one action will complete the task, write down the next action. Then decide if someone else
should do the next action. If someone else should do the next action, have them do it. Then mark the task with waiting.
If you need to do it, mark it as deferred. It is ok to add a deadline and a timestamp.
Once have have a tagged list of deferred items, it is time to tag those deferred items into the calender or nextaction. Next actions
might need to be further tagged into school, entertaiment, gnu, finance, fitness, job, career, service, community, art. I may decide
later that all of these extra tags are really not needed.
1 collect things that command our attention
2 process what they mean and what to do about them
3 organize the results
4 review what options we have to do
5 act
After you have processed you should have at least 7 basic categories
A Projects list
A project Support material
calendared actions and information. These are things you do on the specified day. I don't need a tag for this though. The stuff that I
need to put on the calender, I will schedule and it will appear in the agenda view. However, if I need to do one task, that is not
associated with a project and will most likely be deleted after I complete it, this would be a good spot to put those tasks.
next actions list these are things you do today.
a waiting for list. These are things you've told other people to do, and you are waiting to hear back from them.
reference material
a someday/maybe list  These are things you might do someday.
It is very important that you keep your items in the appropriate category. If you put stuff in the next items that really should go
to the calendar, then you won't trust your calendar list. You'll have to keep checking your next items list when you want to know when
you need to do something. If you put something under projects that belongs to someday/maybe, then you will waste your time trying to
turn a someday/maybe thing into a project.

<x-color><param>#7CB8BB</param>*** Eggs and Canadian Bacon in Pita Pockets</x-color>

    Ingredients
    1 cup refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed, or 4 eggs, slightly beaten
    3 ounces Canadian-style bacon, finely chopped
    3 tablespoons water
    2 tablespoons sliced green onion (optional)
    1/8 teaspoon salt
    Nonstick cooking spray
    2 large whole wheat pita bread rounds, halved crosswise
    Directions
    In a medium bowl, stir together egg product, Canadian bacon, the water, green onion (if desired), and salt.
    Lightly coat an unheated medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Preheat over medium heat. Add egg mixture to skillet. Cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around edge. Using a spatula or a large spoon, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking about 2 minutes or until egg mixture is cooked through but is still glossy and moist. Remove from heat.
    Fill pita halves with egg mixture.

    1/8 teaspoon ground cumin
    1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
    1/4 cup refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed, or 2 egg whites, slightly beaten
    2 tablespoons chopped tomato
    3 dashes bottled hot pepper sauce (optional)
    1 8 inch whole wheat tortilla, warmed*
    Directions
    Prepare turkey bacon according to package directions; crumble and set aside.
    Coat a medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat; add sweet pepper, cumin, and, if desired, crushed red pepper. Cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes. Add egg product; cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around edge. With a spatula or large spoon, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so that the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes or until egg mixture is cooked through but is still glossy and moist.
    Stir in tomato, bacon, and, if desired, hot pepper sauce. Spoon onto tortilla; roll up.

<x-color><param>#7CB8BB</param>*** Green eggs and ham breakfast burrito</x-color>

    makes 2 servings
    What You'll Need:
    1/4 cup pancetta, diced
    4 eggs
    2 tablespoons milk
    1/2 tablespoon olive oil
    2 tablespoons pesto
    2 whole wheat tortillas
    Salt
    Fresh ground pepper
    What to Do:
    Heat a small sauté pan over low heat.
    Add the pancetta and cook until lightly crisp, about 12-15 minutes. Set aside.
    Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs and milk until well combined and pale yellow. Season with salt and pepper.
    Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.
    Add egg mixture to the pan. Let the eggs cook without stirring for a minute or two.
    As the eggs start to set, use a wooden spoon to move the eggs around the pan, forming large curds. Continue cooking,
    stirring constantly, until the eggs set to desired doneness, about 3-5 minutes.
    Drain and discard the oil from the pancetta. Add the meat to the scrambled eggs and mix together.
    Spread 1 tablespoon of pesto across each tortilla.  Divide the egg mixture among each tortilla, and roll burrito.

    serves 2
    What You’ll Need:
    2 whole wheat tortillas
    6 slices of smoked salmon
    1 sliced avocado
    2 handfuls of alfalfa sprouts
    4 eggs
    Salt and pepper to taste
    What To Do:
    Warm up the tortillas for a few minutes in the toaster oven. (No toaster oven? About 45 seconds in the microwave is just fine.)
    Place three slices of smoked salmon on top of each warmed tortilla.
    Layer on the sliced avocado and a handful of alfalfa sprouts.
    Fry up four eggs total, two per serving, (recommended over easy to medium so the yolk is still a bit runny). Add a pinch of salt and pepper.
    Once eggs are cooked, place on top of the alfalfa sprouts, and break open the yolks. Heat lovers, add a dash of hot sauce for a zesty addition! Enjoy!

<x-color><param>#7CB8BB</param>*** Oven Baked Salman with Avocado Dill yogurt</x-color>

    What You'll Need:
    1 medium avocado, diced (skin and pit removed)
    1/2 cup Greek yogurt
    3 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
    1 clove garlic
    2 tablespoons lemon juice
    1-3 tablespoons water
    Salt
    Fresh ground pepper
    4 6-oz salmon fillets
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    What to Do:
    Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
    While the oven heats up, prepare the yogurt sauce. In a food processor or blender, combine the avocado, Greek yogurt,
    dill, garlic, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon water, salt, and pepper. Puree the mixture until smooth and creamy. If necessary,
    add more water one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency. Set aside.
    Place fish, skin side down, on a foil-lined baking sheet. Season with fillets with salt and pepper and brush with olive
    oil (about 1 tablespoon total).
    Bake fish (without flipping) until just cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes, (depending on thickness). (Note: Thicker,
    center-cut fillets will take longer, while thinner fillets cut from the tail section will cook faster.)
    Once cooked, remove from oven and plate each fillet. Top with 1-2 tablespoons of the avocado-dill yogurt, and enjoy!

    Salt and pepper

     1 scallion, sliced
     2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
     3 teaspoons canola oil, divided
     2 teaspoons lime juice
     1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
     1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, divided
     1 15-ounce can pinto beans, rinsed
     1/2 cup prepared green salsa , (see Tip)
     8 6-inch corn tortillas
     Canola oil cooking spray
     3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
     4 large eggs
     Preparation
     Preheat oven to 400°F.
     Combine lettuce, scallion, cilantro, 1 teaspoon oil, lime juice, 1/8 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in a bowl;
     set aside. Combine beans and salsa in another bowl.
     Coat both sides of each tortilla with cooking spray. Place tortillas on a large baking sheet in 4 sets of overlapping pairs.
     (Each pair should overlap by about 3 inches.) Spread about 1/3 cup of the bean mixture on top of each pair of tortillas and

      Function keys <<F5> through <<F9> without modifier keys are also reserved for users to define. Sequences
      consisting of C-c followed by a control character or a digit are reserved for major modes. Sequences
      consisting of C-c followed by {, }, <<, >, : or ; are also reserved for major modes. Sequences
      consisting of C-c followed by any other punctuation character are allocated for minor modes. Using
      them in a major mode is not absolutely prohibited, but if you do that, the major mode binding may be
      shadowed from time to time by minor modes. Don't bind C-h following any prefix character (including
      C-c). If you don't bind C-h, it is automatically available as a help character for listing the
      subcommands of the prefix character. Don't bind a key sequence ending in <<ESC> except following
      another <<ESC>. (That is, it is OK to bind a sequence ending in <<ESC> <<ESC>.)

      The reason for this rule is that a non-prefix binding for <<ESC> in any context prevents recognition of
      escape sequences as function keys in that context. Similarly, don't bind a key sequence ending in
      <<C-g>, since that is commonly used to cancel a key sequence. Anything that acts like a temporary mode
      or state that the user can enter and leave should define <<ESC> <<ESC> or <<ESC> <<ESC> <<ESC> as a way to
      escape.

      For a state that accepts ordinary Emacs commands, or more generally any kind of state in which <<ESC>
      followed by a function key or arrow key is potentially meaningful, then you must not define <<ESC>
      <<ESC>, since that would preclude recognizing an escape sequence after <<ESC>. In these states, you
      should define <<ESC> <<ESC> <<ESC> as the way to escape. Otherwise, define <<ESC> <<ESC> instead.

<x-color><param>#BFEBBF</param>** ifconig is no longer used Plug iptables.</x-color>

   There's 5 tables

   raw

   filter...default where

   Nat is where port forwarding happening...the network can connect to many different stuff...ie: ssh,
   apache


   Chains are ways of storing different rules. Chains are the default way of directing traffick.

   Rules are set under a table and a chain. they are made with iptables.  Rules are a way to make an
   exception to chains.

   Check out the arch wiki for iptables.

   iptables are a way to filter incoming traffic.

   iptables -n -L -v

   iptables -A INPUT -s www.facebook.com -j DROP #block facebook

   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp

   tcp having a connection and sending a package. It is designed for low network signal. It is very low
   level.

   udp sending packages


   iptables iA OUTPUT -p tcp -ddport 80 -j DROP


   ssh uses port 22 by default

   port 80 is used by http by default

   ftp is 21 by default.


   I can change my chains...

   iptables -P OUTPUT -j DROP


   how to log all of your network traffic

   iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOGGING

   iptables -A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 5/m --limit-burst 7 -j LOG --log-prefix "OUTPUT"


   iptables -X deletes all of your chains

   iptables -F deletes all your rules


   you only want some ports open....

   iptables -P OUTPUT DROP

   port forwarding allows you to connect to one server with different protocols.


   to save iptables stuff you have to iptables-save can save your configurations. It might persist through
   reboots.


   DROP means your networking traffic is set up against a firewall.

   iptables -P OUTPUT -j DROP means that your OUTPUT is not allowed.
