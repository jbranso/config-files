* collection notes
write down a quick note of the stuff you need done. Don't think about next action items or scheduling. Just write down
the things you need to do.
* process notes
process the top item first and work your way down one at a time. Don't skip items unless skipping will appease your adhd.
If you are going down the list, and see something that needs attention further on, don't skip the item that you are on. If you do,
you are likely to forget the stuff that you are doing now.
Look at the item and first figure out if you do it.
If you can't act on it, delete it, incubate it for later review, store it as reference material.
If you can act on it, determine the next action and if it will take less than 2 minutes to do it, do it.
If it will take longer than 2 minutes, determine if it is a project and mark it as such, so you can do the next next action
after the next action is done.
If it is a task, which means one action will complete the task, write down the next action. Then decide if someone else
should do the next action. If someone else should do the next action, have them do it. Then mark the task with waiting.
If you need to do it, mark it as deferred. It is ok to add a deadline and a timestamp.
Once have have a tagged list of deferred items, it is time to tag those deferred items into the calender or nextaction. Next actions
might need to be further tagged into school, entertaiment, gnu, finance, fitness, job, career, service, community, art. I may decide
later that all of these extra tags are really not needed.
1 collect things that command our attention
2 process what they mean and what to do about them
3 organize the results
4 review what options we have to do
5 act
After you have processed you should have at least 7 basic categories
A Projects list
A project Support material
calendared actions and information. These are things you do on the specified day. I don't need a tag for this though. The stuff that I
need to put on the calender, I will schedule and it will appear in the agenda view. However, if I need to do one task, that is not
associated with a project and will most likely be deleted after I complete it, this would be a good spot to put those tasks.
next actions list these are things you do today.
a waiting for list. These are things you've told other people to do, and you are waiting to hear back from them.
reference material
a someday/maybe list  These are things you might do someday.
It is very important that you keep your items in the appropriate category. If you put stuff in the next items that really should go
to the calendar, then you won't trust your calendar list. You'll have to keep checking your next items list when you want to know when
you need to do something. If you put something under projects that belongs to someday/maybe, then you will waste your time trying to
turn a someday/maybe thing into a project.

*** Eggs and Canadian Bacon in Pita Pockets
    Ingredients
    1 cup refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed, or 4 eggs, slightly beaten
    3 ounces Canadian-style bacon, finely chopped
    3 tablespoons water
    2 tablespoons sliced green onion (optional)
    1/8 teaspoon salt
    Nonstick cooking spray
    2 large whole wheat pita bread rounds, halved crosswise
    Directions
    In a medium bowl, stir together egg product, Canadian bacon, the water, green onion (if desired), and salt.
    Lightly coat an unheated medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Preheat over medium heat. Add egg mixture to skillet. Cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around edge. Using a spatula or a large spoon, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking about 2 minutes or until egg mixture is cooked through but is still glossy and moist. Remove from heat.
    Fill pita halves with egg mixture.
*** Breakfast Tortilla Wrap
    makes 1 serving
    Ingredients
    1 slice turkey bacon
    Nonstick cooking spray
    2 tablespoons chopped green sweet pepper

    1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
    1/4 cup refrigerated or frozen egg product, thawed, or 2 egg whites, slightly beaten
    2 tablespoons chopped tomato
    3 dashes bottled hot pepper sauce (optional)
    1 8 inch whole wheat tortilla, warmed*
    Directions
    Prepare turkey bacon according to package directions; crumble and set aside.
    Coat a medium nonstick skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat skillet over medium heat; add sweet pepper, cumin, and, if desired, crushed red pepper. Cook and stir until tender, about 3 minutes. Add egg product; cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to set on the bottom and around edge. With a spatula or large spoon, lift and fold the partially cooked egg mixture so that the uncooked portion flows underneath. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes or until egg mixture is cooked through but is still glossy and moist.
    Stir in tomato, bacon, and, if desired, hot pepper sauce. Spoon onto tortilla; roll up.
*** Blueberry Overnight Oats
    makes 2 servings
    Ingredients
    1 cup whole oats
    1 tablespoon chia seeds
    1 tablespoon ground flax
    1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
    1 - 1 1/4 cups almond milk (depending on how thick you like your oats)
    1/4 cup Greek yogurt
    1 tablespoons honey
    1 teaspoon vanilla
    1/2 cup fresh blueberries, plus more for topping
    sliced almonds, for topping
    Instructions
    Combine all ingredients, with the exception of the almonds, in a bowl (or a jar) and mix together. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
    In the morning, remove oats from the refrigerator, divide between two bowls and top with more blueberries and sliced almonds.
*** Pumpkin Oatmeal Breakfast
    1 3/4 cups almond milk or water
    1/2 cup uncooked quick oats
    1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree
    1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
    Dash of sea salt
    maple syrup, nuts, and coconut flakes for garnish
    Instructions
    In a saucepan, bring almond milk or water to a boil and stir in oats, canned pumpkin and pumpkin spice. Reduce heat immediately
    and let the mixture simmer a few minutes, stirring until oats are cooked. Serve with a sprinkle of coconut flakes, chopped pecans,
    and/or drizzled maple syrup.
*** Green eggs and ham breakfast burrito
    makes 2 servings
    What You'll Need:
    1/4 cup pancetta, diced
    4 eggs
    2 tablespoons milk
    1/2 tablespoon olive oil
    2 tablespoons pesto
    2 whole wheat tortillas
    Salt
    Fresh ground pepper
    What to Do:
    Heat a small sauté pan over low heat.
    Add the pancetta and cook until lightly crisp, about 12-15 minutes. Set aside.
    Meanwhile, in a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs and milk until well combined and pale yellow. Season with salt and pepper.
    Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat.
    Add egg mixture to the pan. Let the eggs cook without stirring for a minute or two.
    As the eggs start to set, use a wooden spoon to move the eggs around the pan, forming large curds. Continue cooking,
    stirring constantly, until the eggs set to desired doneness, about 3-5 minutes.
    Drain and discard the oil from the pancetta. Add the meat to the scrambled eggs and mix together.
    Spread 1 tablespoon of pesto across each tortilla.  Divide the egg mixture among each tortilla, and roll burrito.
*** Smoked Salmon and egg tortilla
    serves 2
    What You’ll Need:
    2 whole wheat tortillas
    6 slices of smoked salmon
    1 sliced avocado
    2 handfuls of alfalfa sprouts
    4 eggs
    Salt and pepper to taste
    What To Do:
    Warm up the tortillas for a few minutes in the toaster oven. (No toaster oven? About 45 seconds in the microwave is just fine.)
    Place three slices of smoked salmon on top of each warmed tortilla.
    Layer on the sliced avocado and a handful of alfalfa sprouts.
    Fry up four eggs total, two per serving, (recommended over easy to medium so the yolk is still a bit runny). Add a pinch of salt and pepper.
    Once eggs are cooked, place on top of the alfalfa sprouts, and break open the yolks. Heat lovers, add a dash of hot sauce for a zesty addition! Enjoy!

*** Oven Baked Salman with Avocado Dill yogurt
    What You'll Need:
    1 medium avocado, diced (skin and pit removed)
    1/2 cup Greek yogurt
    3 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
    1 clove garlic
    2 tablespoons lemon juice
    1-3 tablespoons water
    Salt
    Fresh ground pepper
    4 6-oz salmon fillets
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    What to Do:
    Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

    Salt and pepper
    2-3 tablespoons olive oil

**** Huevos Rancheros Verdes
     Ingredients
     1 1/2 cups very thinly sliced romaine lettuce
     1 scallion, sliced
     2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
     3 teaspoons canola oil, divided
     2 teaspoons lime juice
     1/4 teaspoon salt, divided
     1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper, divided
     1 15-ounce can pinto beans, rinsed
     1/2 cup prepared green salsa , (see Tip)

     Canola oil cooking spray
     3/4 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese
     4 large eggs
     Preparation

**** bind a command that evaluates current lisp list
**** C-c letter are reserved for users according to the emacs manual
     Function keys <F5> through <F9> without modifier keys are also reserved for users to define. Sequences
     consisting of C-c followed by a control character or a digit are reserved for major modes. Sequences
     consisting of C-c followed by {, }, <, >, : or ; are also reserved for major modes. Sequences
     consisting of C-c followed by any other punctuation character are allocated for minor modes. Using
     them in a major mode is not absolutely prohibited, but if you do that, the major mode binding may be
     shadowed from time to time by minor modes. Don't bind C-h following any prefix character (including
     C-c). If you don't bind C-h, it is automatically available as a help character for listing the
     subcommands of the prefix character. Don't bind a key sequence ending in <ESC> except following
     another <ESC>. (That is, it is OK to bind a sequence ending in <ESC> <ESC>.)
     The reason for this rule is that a non-prefix binding for <ESC> in any context prevents recognition of
     escape sequences as function keys in that context. Similarly, don't bind a key sequence ending in
     <C-g>, since that is commonly used to cancel a key sequence. Anything that acts like a temporary mode
     or state that the user can enter and leave should define <ESC> <ESC> or <ESC> <ESC> <ESC> as a way to
     escape.
     For a state that accepts ordinary Emacs commands, or more generally any kind of state in which <ESC>
     followed by a function key or arrow key is potentially meaningful, then you must not define <ESC>
     <ESC>, since that would preclude recognizing an escape sequence after <ESC>. In these states, you
     should define <ESC> <ESC> <ESC> as the way to escape. Otherwise, define <ESC> <ESC> instead.

**** killall [-9|-15]  <program name>     kills programs
**** kill [-9|-15] <process_id>     kills a process id
**** ps aux | grep program name or ps -e | grep program name..... can get you a program's process.
**** if the above command says the status is a D, then the program is sleeping and is wating for I/O. At this point,
    one cannot kill it; one can only wait. If status is Z (zombie)
    try to kill it. R/S is normal.

** TODO If I work out 1-3 hours a week, then according to Scooby's :fitness:reference:
calorie counter, I need to eat 2,616 calories a day, which is about 10%
more than my body needs, which should be ok. 20% (523 calories) of that
will be protein, 60% carbs (1570 calories), and 20% (532 calories) fat.
As a rule of thumb, to convert between grams and calories...
1 gram of carbs   = 4  calories
1 gram of protien = 4  calories
1 gram of fat     = 9 calories
** There are so many branches of open source operating systems: :COMPUTER:reference:
*** GNU/Linux
*** GNU/Hurd
*** BSDs
*** Helen OS
*** illumos
*** open Indiana
*** Dyson...debian userspace
*** BeOS
*** Haiku
*** Sphinx
*** Minix
installed qemu and wget
the emacs network utilities could use help documenting stuff
I added joshua to systemd-journal to grant that user access to journalctl's log messages.
computer stuff to do, non programming    :Computer:
** Scooby's calories calculator
   I need to eat 3600 calories, 126 g protein, and 54 g carbs per day.
   That works out to 21 g of protein, 64 grams of carbs, and 9 grams of fat per meal. (assuming 6 meals per
   day.)
** ifconig is no longer used Plug iptables.
   There's 5 tables
   raw
   filter...default where
   Nat is where port forwarding happening...the network can connect to many different stuff...ie: ssh,
   apache

   Chains are ways of storing different rules. Chains are the default way of directing traffick.
   Rules are set under a table and a chain. they are made with iptables.  Rules are a way to make an
   exception to chains.
   Check out the arch wiki for iptables.
   iptables are a way to filter incoming traffic.
   iptables -n -L -v
   iptables -A INPUT -s www.facebook.com -j DROP #block facebook
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp
   tcp having a connection and sending a package. It is designed for low network signal. It is very low
   level.
   udp sending packages

   iptables iA OUTPUT -p tcp -ddport 80 -j DROP

   ssh uses port 22 by default
   port 80 is used by http by default
   ftp is 21 by default.

   I can change my chains...
   iptables -P OUTPUT -j DROP

   how to log all of your network traffic
   iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOGGING
   iptables -A OUTPUT -m limit --limit 5/m --limit-burst 7 -j LOG --log-prefix "OUTPUT"

   iptables -X deletes all of your chains
   iptables -F deletes all your rules

   you only want some ports open....
   iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
   port forwarding allows you to connect to one server with different protocols.

   to save iptables stuff you have to iptables-save can save your configurations. It might persist through
   reboots.

   DROP means your networking traffic is set up against a firewall.
   iptables -P OUTPUT -j DROP means that your OUTPUT is not allowed.

* weekly review
** check out awful.widget.prompt That may allow me to place a widget or launcher onto the screen,
   without using a wibox.
** There's no arch wiki page for gimp.
** computer stuff you can say you did:
*** installed yaourt to install pipelight
*** changed bash aliases
*** made terminal transparent
*** run awesome in a nested x session
*** saved config file in github
*** I added a global key to move clients to the next tag May 8th
*** on May 9th, I made a script that commits my modified files to my machine, and then uploads them to my github account.
*** May 9th, I've got a working volume widget.
*** May 10th, found a bug in volume widget. corrected it.
*** to get systemd to run my github.service as user joshua, I need to create a seperate instance of systemd. I've
    bookmarked the relevent guides.
*** May 11th, compiled a texinfo documentation.
*** May 11th got my apple color profile working by installing xcalib and pointing it to my color profile I saved from
    Mac OSX
*** May 13th I fixed a tiny buy in my rc.lua. I can now switch one client to another tag.
*** May 14th, compiled a texinfo file into a pdf, info, plaintext?
*** May 17th, I make systemd services that messed with pacman database, and prelinked binaries.
*** June 4th, I made keydoc work with awesome
*** June 7th, I customized the crap out of viper mode, added several defuns and split up my emacs config
*** June 8th, I added a ton of abbreviations
*** Sept 11, I made a button that hides the .navPanel on soihub
*** sept 12, I created a cookie that remembers if you want the .navPanel hidden or not.
*** create a series of scripts that monitors logs. It'll make a pop up when an "error" is found in /var/log
   one can use this command grep "error" * in /var/log
   Also check journalctl with "journalctl -p 0..3"
*** systemd jobs. These need to be calendar jobs. Otherwise, lots of jobs will happen at once.
   Also these scripts need to be in group root. If not, then root
   cannot execute them. aka systemd cannot execute them. Also you can
   change the permissions to 755, which lets owner, group, and others
   execute the program.
*** add a reflectory systemd cron job. This will check the recent mirrorlists, will find fast working mirrors, and
   will change my /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist accordingly.  sudo reflector --verbose --country 'United States'
   -l 10 -p http --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist *** sudo pacman-optimize will optimize the
   database. makes pacman's job faster... will happen on monday *** prelink will happen on tuesday ** make a
   program that will autoprompt me to install updates.
