These are my config files for emacs and rc.lua (the awesome window manager)
among other projects.

Fair warning. I use a dvorak keyboard and I love evil-mode, so my modified
keybindings reflect this. My .emacs.d comes from
https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d, but I've changed some things.

You should use my init.el if you use the dvorak keyboard layout
(http://mashable.com/2012/09/18/qwerty-keyboard/) and if you're
interested in:

auto-complete: (http://auto-complete.org/)
helm-mode:     (https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html) helm rocks!
evil-mode:     vim emualtion on emacs
evil-surround: (https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround) This is super useful!
web-mode:      (http://web-mode.org/)
golden-ratio:  (https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el) it's more useful than
               you might think.
