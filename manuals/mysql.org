  MySQL comes with 4 groups of data types:

  - Numbers
  - Text
  - Date and Time
  - Defined groups

**  The Numbers group has 1 group called integers.  These numbers can be used to utilize MySQL’s math functions:
  - TINYINT   (-120 - 120)            or (0 - 255)
  - SMALLINT  (-32,000 - 32,000       or (0 - 65,000)
  - MEDIUMINT (-8 million- 8 million) or (0 - 16 million)
  - INT
  - BIGINT

  Any of those types can be signed up unsigned.  *Signed* means the integer can be hold negative of or positive values.
  *Unsigned* means the integer can only be positive.

  MySQL also supports Numeric and Decimal data Types, which are data types that store numbers, but once stored cannot be changed.
  This is a safety feature.  Suppose you want to store valuable numerical data, but do not want someone accidentally changed via a
  MySQL’s mathematical function.

  Float and double are also there.  They are for numbers like 5.23409348.  For comparision of equality of numbers, float is the
  best option.

**  Representing Text

    Text has a couple of ways to be put in a MySQL database.

    - Char      (a contstant length of a string, that will next change.  It can be between 1-255 characters long).
    - varchar   (a string that might change.  It can be between 1-255 characters long).
    - text      (a long string that might change)
    - blob      (a long string that might change)

    With both char and varchar, you can specify an upper limit of what the string might be.  For example, you can specify that for
    all of your varchars in a particuar table are only going to store the news headlines that are not quite finished as articles.
    The title may change, but you will probably not ever see a title that is 255 chars long.  You could make the maximum to be 70
    chars long.

    You can also do the same for a char, and specify the longest it will ever be in a table as well.  This speeds up access time!

    Blob types are case sensitive.  So MySQL will order Johnny, jOhnny, joHnny, johNny, johnNy, johnnY a very certain way, but
    text types will see no differance between those names.

    You can choose from

    - tinytext and tinyblob
    - text and blob
    - mediumtext and mediumblob
    - longtext and longblob

** time and date in MySQL

   here in the format:

   <YEAR>-<MONTH>-<Day> <Hour>-<Minutes>-<Seconds>

** Set ond enum types

   These are like structs in C.  You can group several different types inside on thing.

* Inserting data into tables

  -  INSERT ...  VALUES

     -- INSERT INTO  <table_name>  [<column_name1>[,column_name2, ...]  VALUES  <column_value1>[, <column_value2>,...];

     INSERT INTO duck_title
     VALUES
     (1, ’Mr.’),
     (2, ’Ms.’),
     (3, ’Mrs.’);

  -  INSERT ...  SET

     -- INSERT INTO <table_name>
        SET <column_name>=<column_value>[, <column_name>=<column_value>,...];

  -  INSERT ...  SELECT

     -- INSERT INTO <table_name> [column_name1[, column_name2,...]
        SELECT <select_value> FROM <table_name>;


  -  LOAD DATA INFILE

  - CREATE TABLE copy-table
    SELECT * FROM original-table

* COMMENT getting information from tables

  - SELECT * from table-name;

  - SELECT column1.table-name, column2.table-name[, column3.table-name...];

  - SELECT * from table-name LIMIT number;
    the number, limits how many results you get

  - SELECT [DISTINCT] column-name FROM table-name
    This ensures that there are no two of the same values returned for column-name

  - SELECT car.length, car.color FROM car
    WHERE car_color=“green”
    AND car.length>72;

  - SELECT person.fname, person.age FROM person
    WHERE person.name=“John”
    OR person.age>10;

  - SELECT * FROM toys
    WHERE toys.color IS <NOT NULL | NULL>

  - SELECT * FROM dolls
    WHERE price.dolls>10
    ORDER BY name.dolls;

  - SELECT SUM(house-points), AVG (student-tests) FROM hogwardsGryffendor;

  - SELECT <MAX | MIN>  rent FROM apt;

  - SELECT ROUND (going-out-to-eat) FROM expenses;

  - SELECT fname, mname, lname FROM person;

  - SELECT fname, lname FROM students
    GROUB BY lname;

    This groups the output by last name.  This would be a decent way to determine if you had any siblings at your school.

  - SELECT fname, lname, score FROM students
    GROUB BY lname
    HAVING score>=200;
