    To find all of the selected files (including sub-directories) and then delete them

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir ~/programming/waypoint/nutripledge/
   find . -name \*.pdf -exec /bin/rm {} \;
   #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:

* permissions
In Unix everything is a file.  When you write a text document called "text.text", that is a Unix file.  When you create a directory (Windows users call this a folder) called "Music",  you also are creating a Unix file.  Obviously, "text.text" and "Music" behave very differently.  One has your favorite songs, and the other is a text document, BUT the linux kernel assumes that they are both Unix files.  All unix files have read, write, and execute permissions specific to each unix file.  This typiccally means that the ordinary user joshua cannot read, write, or execute anything in the =/root/= folder.

# I found this segment online here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6732430/how-do-i-give-write-permission-to-file-in-linux
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
read     = 4
write    = 2
execute  = 1
owner    = read | write = 6
group    = read         = 4
other    = read         = 4
The basic syntax of the command to set the mode is

chmod 644 [file name]
In C, that would be

#include <sys/stat.h>

chmod("[file name]", 0644);
 #+END_SRC

** chmod

chmod [-R ] <owner> [file | directory]

Change a file's modifications.  This specifies if what user, group, and if everyone else can read, write, or execute the file.

Permissions can modify the permissions of the user's, the group's and all others.

** chown

chown [-R] <owner> [file | directory]

Change the file's owner.  The file's owner is typically root or an ordinary user.

Examples include


** chgrp

chgrp [ -R ] <group> [file | directory]

Change the group that the file or directory belongs to.

* How I got my local apache server working again:

 For some reason, my ~/ folder had permissions =drwxrws---=

 To fix it I did

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both
 cd /home/; chmod g-s joshua; ls -lh | grep joshua

 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : drwxrwx--- 83 joshua http 4.0K Feb  2 08:04 joshua

The s was magically replaced with a x
