# My Awesome Config Files

Hello, I'm an arch linux user, and these are my config files notable for rc.lua  (the awesome window manager http://awesome.naquadah.org/)
among other projects.


*NOTE: The .emacs.d/ is an outdated directory.  Use my .emacs.d/ repo (https://github.com/jbranso/.emacs.d) for the updated version.*

The awesome window manager is a keyboard driven window manager.  A window manager only controls how your programs are displayed
on the screen. It does not by default automatically open CDs or DVDs when you insert them, nor does it turn your screen brighter
when you press the TRUN-BRIGHTER screen button, nor does it provide commonly used programs used by GNOME or KDE.  If you're a programmer, and you need control over your where and how your programs get displayed on screen, then awesome is for you!


Cheers.
