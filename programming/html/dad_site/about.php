	      This silly paragraph explains the image to the right. Obviously you can't put a picture up on
	      a website and not explain it. This is one of our hardest workers after a long day. He's also our
	      local vet. You might think that in this image, he is sleeping, but you'd be wrong. He's actually
	      listening to this cow's heart beat.

	      This is a silly paragraph. That explains that large tractor to the right. Am I right? What
	      kind of farmer does not have a large tractor that he calls baby? No farmer that I know. THat is
	      for sure!
