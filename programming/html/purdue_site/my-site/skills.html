                    I used HTML and CSS to create responsive and modern looking web pages (including this site,
                    which uses twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>). Javascript and jQuery were helpful in
                    creating simple web scripts. php, and MySQL.

                    For several years, my operating system has been GNU/Linux, and I am familiar with several such distributions, with
                    which I have used several programming and markup languages. I have used and customized the emacs text editor and
                    have written one package for it: <a href="https://github.com/jbranso/evil-dvorak">evil-dvorak.</a>
