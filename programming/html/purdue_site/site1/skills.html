                    I've used HTML and CSS to create responsive and modern looking web pages (including this site,
                    which uses twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">bootstrap</a>). Javascript and jQuery were helpful in
                    creating simple web scripts. php, and MySQL.

                    Operate and run Arch Linux on a Macbook, from which I have acquired a good working knowledge of UNIX commands including chmod, chown, chgrp, ls, cd, cp, mv, etc.

                    Can partition hard drives and create ext2, ext3, ext4, btrfs, and more filesystems.

                    Can configure the bootloader grub2 to decrease boot time and change the linux kernel boot options.

                    Can configure initial ram disk environment to load specific kernel modules early in the boot process including nouveau, ext4, and others.
