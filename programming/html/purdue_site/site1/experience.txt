I worked for Purdue's Agriculture Information Technology (AgIT). I
installed Windows on Dells, HPs, ThinkPads, etc. I also installed Mac OSX on

I worked with active directory, and I troubleshooted users' problems for
several campus buildings including Lilly Hall, the Biochemestry building,
Smith Hall, Nelson Hall, and others.
