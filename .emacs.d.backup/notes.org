** TODO When opening magit-status from with gtd.org and commiting and pushing changes,
   then when I type q, to close the magit buffer, what was the magit buffer turns into
   the scratch buffer. So I end up with having 2 frames. One is my org buffer and the
   other is the scratch buffer. I would like to be able to type q on magit, and move to
   my org buffer.
