;;; Commentary:

;; This is a Magit extension for manipulating GitHub pull requests

;; No configuration is needed in the repository if any of your remotes contain a
;; URL to Github's remote repository. If for some reason you don't have any
;; Github remotes in your config, you can specify username and repository
;; explicitly:

;; $ git config magit.gh-pulls-repo <user>/<repo> # your github repository

;; Add these lines to your init.el:

;; (require 'magit-gh-pulls.el)
;; (add-hook 'magit-mode-hook 'turn-on-magit-gh-pulls)

;; There are currently 4 bindings for pull requests:
;; # g g --- refreshes the list of pull requests
;; # g f --- fetches the commits associated with the pull request at point
;; # g b --- helps you creating a topic branch from a review request
;; # g m --- merges the PR on top of the current branch
;; # g c --- creates a PR from the current branch

;; Then, you can do whatever you want with the commit objects associated with
;; the pull request (merge, cherry-pick, diff, ...)
